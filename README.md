## Projects
### KNN for Network Intrusion Detection, _Michigan Data Science Team Project_
The goal of this project was to develop a machine learning model for network intrusion detection using the KDD Cup '99 Dataset as a part of the Michigan Data Science Team. My group and I chose to develop a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier that was trained to categorize network traffic into three areas: "smurf" and "neptune" attacks, and "normal" traffic. The dataset was preprocessed by scaling numerical features and encoding categorical variables. The model achieved a high training accuracy and weighted precision demonstrated by the confusion matrix and classification report.

### Ethical Fashion Consumption, _Needs and Usability Assesment Course_
In my project on ethical fashion consumption, I conducted a comprehensive study to understand how consumer attitudes contribute to the fast fashion phenomenon and sought to identify challenges consumers face when attemoting to make sustainable fashion choices. Through a series of interviews with diverse participants aged 18-45, I gathered valuable insights into their shopping habits, decision-making processes, and perceptions of sustainable fashion.   

To analyze the interview data, I performed affinity mapping, categorizing key findings into themes such as the influence of special occasions on purchasing decisions, the lack of transparency regarding brands' sustainability practices, the perceived higher costs of sustainable fashion, and the convenience factor that drives consumers to fast fashion retailers. These themes informed the creation of a representative user persona, "Eco-Conscious Emily," which encapsulated the needs, goals, and frustrations of environmentally conscious consumers.

Additionally, I developed a journey map to visually represent the key touchpoints and interactions consumers have with fashion retailers throughout their purchasing journey. This map helped identify pain points and areas for improvement in the shopping process. Based on the research findings, I proposed several design recommendations to align with consumer needs and encourage sustainable fashion choices. These recommendations included implementing intuitive interfaces with easily accessible information on sustainable and ethical fashion, providing clear labels and filters to identify eco-friendly brands, and introducing features such as discounts or rewards to incentivize sustainable purchases. Throughout this project, I refined my interview techniques, learned to avoid loaded language, and recognized the importance of observation in addressing potential biases. By employing a user-centric approach and leveraging insights from consumer interviews, I aimed to contribute to the development of solutions that promote ethical fashion consumption and reduce the impact of fast fashion on the environment.
