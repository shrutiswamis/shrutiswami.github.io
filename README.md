## Projects
### KNN for Network Intrusion Detection
The goal of this project was to develop a machine learning model for network intrusion detection using the KDD Cup '99 Dataset as a part of the Michigan Data Science Team. My group and I chose to develop a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier that was trained to categorize network traffic into three areas: "smurf" and "neptune" attacks, and "normal" traffic. The dataset was preprocessed by scaling numerical features and encoding categorical variables. The model achieved a high training accuracy and weighted precision demonstrated by the confusion matrix and classification report.
